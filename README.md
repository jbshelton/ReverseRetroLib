# Reverse Retro's Engineering Library
I created this repository in order to share some of the resources I created while working on a few projects, including my own Gameboy Color reproduction circuit board. Everything was designed to be used with KiCad 6.

## Important note
This repo is currently undergoing some reworking to transform it from just stuff I made/used for my GBC repro to a collection of footprints, symbols, documentation, etc. for other stuff. I will be adding more non-Gameboy files here in the future, including symbols for the TCT-97x SNES clone chips. All of the existing/old files are in the "Gameboy" folder.
